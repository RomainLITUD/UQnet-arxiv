# UQnet

This is the official pytorch source code for the paper manuscript *<UQnet: quantifying spatial uncertainty in trajectory prediction by a non-parametric and generalizable approach>*. The used INTERACTION dataset can be found by [this link](https://interaction-dataset.com/). After getting data, please put them in the `interaction_data` folder. All trained predictors are in the `interactionDE` folder.

We also provide an online demo that shows how UQnet works: [DittLab Demo Zone](http://mirrors-dev.citg.tudelft.nl:8082/uqnet-main.py/). People can choose scenarios, run the model, see the predictions, rank and evaluate the cases by different uncertainty metrics.
